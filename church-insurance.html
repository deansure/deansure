    <article class="post-content">
      <p>Churches in Missouri face unique risks — from storm damage to volunteer drivers. Yet many ministries carry policies that leave dangerous gaps. At Deansure LLC, we believe insurance should protect your mission, not complicate it. Here’s a practical guide to the coverages every church should consider, the factors that drive premiums, and how an independent agency can help.</p>

      <h2>Coverage Checklist for Churches</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>General Liability:</strong> Protects against injuries on church property.</li>
        <li><strong>Property Insurance:</strong> Covers buildings, contents, and equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Abuse & Molestation Liability:</strong> Critical for youth programs.</li>
        <li><strong>Hired & Non‑Owned Auto:</strong> Covers volunteers driving personal vehicles.</li>
        <li><strong>Workers’ Compensation:</strong> Required for staff; protects volunteers in some cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Directors & Officers:</strong> Shields leadership from governance‑related claims.</li>
        <li><strong>Special Events Coverage:</strong> For concerts, fundraisers, or community outreach.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Drives Premiums in Missouri</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Building age and roof condition (hail and storm risk).</li>
        <li>Claims history and prior losses.</li>
        <li>Congregation size and youth program activity.</li>
        <li>Vehicles owned or frequently used by the church.</li>
        <li>Events hosted on or off property.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Gaps We See</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Volunteers driving personal cars without HNOA coverage.</li>
        <li>Equipment taken off‑site for events.</li>
        <li>Limited counseling or pastoral liability coverage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Local Example</h2>
      <p>A Pacific, MO church added hired & non‑owned auto coverage after realizing volunteer drivers weren’t protected. The premium increase was modest, but the peace of mind was priceless.</p>

      <h2>Why Work With an Independent Agency</h2>
      <p>Unlike captive carriers, we shop multiple insurers to find the right fit for your ministry. Our role is to advise, not sell — ensuring your church is protected with integrity and clarity.</p>
