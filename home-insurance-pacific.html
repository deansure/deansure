        When most people in Pacific think about home insurance, they assume their premium is based only on the size of their house or the value of their belongings. While those factors matter, there’s a bigger story behind the numbers — one that many homeowners don’t realize.
      </p>

      <h2>The Missouri Storm Factor</h2>
      <p>In 2025, insurers across Missouri absorbed nearly <strong>$1.8 billion</strong> in catastrophic storm losses. Hail, wind, and tornadoes hit our state harder than most, and when carriers take heavy losses, they often raise rates across the board to recover. That means even if you’ve never filed a claim, your premium may still rise because of what’s happening statewide.</p>

      <blockquote class="pull-quote">
        Losses drive premiums — but not all carriers respond the same way. Independence matters.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Why Carriers Respond Differently</h2>
      <p>Not all insurance companies react the same way. Some carriers with heavier exposure in Missouri raise rates aggressively, while others with stronger financial positions or different underwriting appetites remain more competitive. This is where an <strong>independent agency</strong> like Deansure LLC helps: we shop multiple carriers — Safeco, Nationwide, Progressive, Travelers, Hartford, and more — to find the right fit.</p>

      <h2>Lesser-Known Premium Drivers</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><span class="label">Roof age & materials</span><span class="detail">A newer roof can mean meaningful savings.</span></li>
        <li><span class="label">Local construction costs</span><span class="detail">Higher lumber and labor raise replacement cost estimates.</span></li>
        <li><span class="label">ZIP code claims history</span><span class="detail">Neighborhood loss patterns affect pricing even without personal claims.</span></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What This Means for Pacific Homeowners</h2>
      <p>If you haven’t reviewed your coverage in the last 2–3 years, there’s a good chance you’re paying more than necessary. Shopping carriers isn’t just about savings — it’s about ensuring your coverage keeps pace with today’s risks. At Deansure, insurance is about clarity, trust, and protecting what matters most.</p>
